# Change Log for rocFFT

Full documentation for rocFFT is available at [rocfft.readthedocs.io](https://rocfft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## (Unreleased) rocFFT 1.0.18

### Changed
- Runtime compilation cache now looks for environment variables XDG_CACHE_HOME (on Linux) and LOCALAPPDATA (on
  Windows) before falling back to HOME.

### Optimizations
- Optimized 2D R2C/C2R to use 2-kernel plans where possible.
- Improved performance of the Bluestein algorithm.
- Optimized sbcc-168 and 100 by using half-lds.

### Fixed
- Fixed occasional failures to parallelize runtime compilation of kernels.
  Failures would be retried serially and ultimately succeed, but this would take extra time.
- Fixed failures of some R2C 3D transforms that use the unsupported TILE_UNALGNED SBRC kernels.
  An example is 98^3 R2C out-of-place.
- Fixed bugs in SBRC_ERC type.

## rocFFT 1.0.17 for ROCm 5.2.0
### Added
- Packages for test and benchmark executables on all supported OSes using CPack.
- Added File/Folder Reorg Changes with backward compatibility support using ROCM-CMAKE wrapper functions.

### Changed
- Improved reuse of twiddle memory between plans.
- Set a default load/store callback when only one callback
  type is set via the API for improved performance.
- Updated googletest dependency to version 1.11.

### Optimizations
- Introduced a new access pattern of lds (non-linear) and applied it on
  sbcc kernels len 64 and 81 to get performance improvement.
- Applied lds-non-linear and direct-load-to-register on sbcr kernels to
  get performance improvement.
- Applied lds-non-linear and direct-store-from-register on sbrc kernels to
  get performance improvement.

### Fixed
- Fixed correctness of certain transforms with unusual strides.
- Fixed incorrect handling of user-specified stream for runtime-compiled kernels.
- Fixed incorrect buffer allocation in rocfft-test on in-place transforms with different input and output sizes.

## rocFFT 1.0.16 for ROCm 5.1.0

### Changed
- Supported unaligned tile dimension for SBRC_2D kernels.
- Improved (more RAII) test and benchmark infrastructure.
- Enabled runtime compilation of length-2304 FFT kernel during plan creation.
- Added tokenizer for test suite.
- Reduce twiddle memory requirements for even-length real-complex transforms.
- Clients can now be built separately from the main library.

### Optimizations
- Optimized more large 1D cases by using L1D_CC plan.
- Optimized 3D 200^3 C2R case.
- Optimized 1D 2^30 double precision on MI200.
- Added padding to work buffer sizes to improve performance in many cases.

### Fixed
- Fixed correctness of some R2C transforms with unusual strides.

### Removed
- The hipFFT API (header) has been removed from after a long deprecation period.  Please use the [hipFFT](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipFFT) package/repository to obtain the hipFFT API.

## rocFFT 1.0.15 for ROCm 5.0.0

### Changed
- Enabled runtime compilation of single FFT kernels > length 1024.
- Re-aligned split device library into 4 roughly equal libraries.
- Implemented the FuseShim framework to replace the original OptimizePlan
- Implemented the generic buffer-assignment framework. The buffer assignment
  is no longer performed by each node. We designed a generic algorithm to
  test and pick the best assignment path.
  With the help of FuseShim, we can achieve more kernel-fusions as possible.
- Do not read the imaginary part of the DC and Nyquist modes for even-length
  complex-to-real transforms.

### Optimizations
- Optimized twiddle-conjugation; complex-to-complex inverse transforms should have similar performance to foward transforms now.
- Improved performance of single-kernel small 2D transforms.

## rocFFT 1.0.14 for ROCm 4.5.0

### Optimizations
- Optimized SBCC kernels of length 52, 60, 72, 80, 84, 96, 104, 108, 112, 160,
  168, 208, 216, 224, 240 with new kernel generator.

### Added
- Added support for Windows 10 as a build target.

### Changed
- Packaging split into a runtime package called rocfft and a development package called rocfft-devel. The development package depends on runtime. The runtime package suggests the development package for all supported OSes except CentOS 7 to aid in the transition. The suggests feature in packaging is introduced as a deprecated feature and will be removed in a future rocm release.

### Fixed
- Fixed a few validation failures of even-length R2C inplace. 2D, 3D cubics sizes such as
  100^2 (or ^3), 200^2 (or ^3), 256^2 (or ^3)...etc. We don't combine the three kernels
  (stockham-r2c-transpose). We only combine two kernels (r2c-transpose) instead.

### Changed
- Split 2D device code into separate libraries.

## rocFFT 1.0.13 for ROCm 4.4.0

### Optimizations
- Improved many plans by removing unnecessary transpose steps.
- Optimized scheme selection for 3D problems.
  - Imposed less restrictions on 3D_BLOCK_RC selection. More problems can use 3D_BLOCK_RC and
    have some performance gain.
  - Enabled 3D_RC. Some 3D problems with SBCC-supported z-dim can use less kernels and get benefit.
  - Force --length 336 336 56 (dp) use faster 3D_RC to avoid it from being skipped by conservative
    threshold test.
- Optimized some even-length R2C/C2R cases by doing more operations
  in-place and combining pre/post processing into Stockham kernels.
- Added radix-17.

### Added
- Added new kernel generator for select fused-2D transforms.

### Fixed
- Improved large 1D transform decompositions.

## rocFFT 1.0.12 for ROCm 4.3.0

### Changed

### Fixed
- Fixed potential crashes in double-precision planar->planar transpose.
- Fixed potential crashes in 3D transforms with unusual strides, for
  SBCC-optimized sizes.
- Improved buffer placement logic.

### Added
- Added new kernel generator for select lengths.  New kernels have
  improved performance.
- Added public `rocfft_execution_info_set_load_callback` and
  `rocfft_execution_info_set_store_callback` API functions to allow
  executing extra logic when loading/storing data from/to global
  memory during a transform.

### Removed
- Removed R2C pair schemes and kernels.

### Optimizations
- Optimized 2D/3D R2C 100 and 1D Z2Z 2500.

  SBCC-optimized sizes.

  supported.
- Explicitly add radix-7 lengths 14, 21, and 224 to list of supported
  lengths.
- Optimized R2C 2D/3D 128, 200, 256 cube sizes.

- Improved performance of the standalone out-of-place transpose kernel.
- Optimized 1D length 40000 C2C case.
- Enabled radix-7 for size 336.
